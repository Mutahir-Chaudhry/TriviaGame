# TriviaGame
What the project does:
This project begins with a screen titled "Random Trivia" and a button. Once the button is clicked, it runs through 10 randomized questions, with each question having 4 possible answers. The user has a time limit of 10 seconds to pick an answer. 
If it is correct, the screen lets the user know they answered the question correctly, and then shortly after loads the next question. If it is wrong, the screen lets the user know they answered the question incorrectly, provides them with the right answer, and then shortly after loads the next question. If a question is not answered within the 10 second limit, the screen lets the user know they have run out of time, and shortly after loads the next question. 
At the end of the 10 randomized quesitons, the screen lets the user know the game is over, their number of correctly, incorrecly, and unanswered question, and provides them with a button to restrat the game.
